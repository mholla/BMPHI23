# dendrite_growth

This code reproduces the results of ``Multiphysics modeling and finite-element formulation of neural dendrite growth with electrical polarization'' submitted to Brain Multiphysics.

## in silico computational simulations

Abaqus input files and user-defined element subroutines are provided to reproduce all the simulations included in the paper. 
The 1-D FEM code in Matlab is also provided for verifying our numerical implementations.

## CNN training 

Python notebook scripts are provided for reproducing CNN training results included in the paper.
